This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and provides a safe solution. Raw pointers offer low-level memory access, but require careful handling to avoid memory safety violations, such as data races, use-after-free, dangling pointers, and memory leaks. The provided example showcases how to correctly utilize safe Rust constructs when such low-level memory manipulation is necessary.
